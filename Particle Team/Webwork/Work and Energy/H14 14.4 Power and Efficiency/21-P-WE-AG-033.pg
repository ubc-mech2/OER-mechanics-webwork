Port Moody has a very large sulphur processing facility. The sulphur is kept in large containers and transported around the site via long conveyer belts. Today, they are loading a ship, which means that the sulphur needs to be placed on the ship at a constant rate of [`[$R]\:\frac{kg}{min}`]. It takes [`[$T]\:minutes`] for the sulphur to get from the container to the ship up a [`[$thetad]\:degree`] slope. Given that the average power consumed by the electric motor running the conveyer shown above is [`[$P]\:watts`] and that the motor is [`[$E]%`] efficient, what is the constant speed at which the conveyer is moving?
