Two proto-engineers need to test their new iteration of the mammoth chariot. They have captured a big mammoth and are now pulling it towards the testing area. 
Right now, the mammoth is stubbornly not moving, but is already exerted to its limit. If \(F_1=$A\:Newtons\) and \(F_2=$B\:Newtons\), then what direction is the mammoth pulling? Select all that apply.

If both the proto-engineers start pulling [`[$P]%`] more and the mammoth weighs [`[$W]\:kg`], what will be the magnitude (+) of the mammoth’s acceleration?
