A [`[$m] \: kg`] cube with sides of [`[$L1] \: meters`] is sitting at the bottom of a pool, the top surface being [`[$H] \: meters`] below the surface of the water. 
The block is attached to the side of the pool with a [`[$L2] \: meter`] long spring that has a spring constant of [`[$SC] \: kN/m`]. The coefficient of friction between the pool bottom and the cube is [`[$mu]`]. 
Additionally, the water opposes movement with a force of [`pressure*frontal\:area`]. Pressure is given by the formula [`{\rho}gh`] where [`\rho`] is the density of the water, [`g`] is gravity, and [`h`] is the average height 
below the surface of the water. There is also a buoyant force acting upwards on the cube, which is defined by [`F_{buoyant}={\rho}gV`], where [`\rho`] is the density of the water, [`g`] is gravity, and [`V`] is the volume displaced by the object upon which the buoyant force acts. If you move the block [`[$D] \: meters`] towards the side of the pool, how much work would be done on the block?

_Take [`\rho=1000 kg/m^3`] and [`g=9.81 m/s^2`]_

[`U_{total} = `][_____]{"$Ut"}[`J`]
