BEGIN_PGML
The figure shows a concept vehicle that runs between two gear racks. The bottom gear rack is fixed and the top gear rack 
is driven at a velocity of [`v = [$v]`] [`m/s`]. The vehicle is unpowered, and consists of a system of compound gears held 
together by a frame ([`\alpha = [$alpha]`][`^\circ`]). Gears A and B share an axle (X) and move at the same angular velocity. 
If [`r_A = [$r_A]`] [`cm`], [`r_B = [$r_B]`] [`cm`] and [`r_C = [$r_C]`] [`cm`], find the magnitude of the velocity of the vehicle.

Hint: This problem can be solved without evaluating of the ICZV of each gear. Be very careful if you do choose to think of ICZVs 
because the system's movement may be counterintuitive and incorrect assumptions can get you stuck!
