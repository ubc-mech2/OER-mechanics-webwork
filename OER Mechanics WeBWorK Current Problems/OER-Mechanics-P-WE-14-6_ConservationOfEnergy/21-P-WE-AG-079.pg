A [`[$W1]\:kg`] truck starts from rest, [`[$h1]\:m`] above the bottom of the hill. [`H=[$h1]\:m`] in the diagram above. The hills are frictionless. 
Think of it as covered with ice (a good approximation for northern BC highways during winter.) Ignore air resistance and all other sources of friction. 
The truck slides down the hill and collides with a car of mass [`[$W2]\:kg`]. The car was at rest at the bottom of the hill before the collision. 
The bumpers stick together after the collision so this is a perfectly inelastic collision. The two vehicles then move up the second hill. 
How high up the second hill will the two vehicles travel before stopping? In other words, what is the maximum height reached or [`H'`] in the diagram?

[`H'=`][_____]{"$h2"}[`m`]
