BEGIN_PGML

Cats are known for batting things off tables or out of the air. You are an cosmonaut currently on a voyage where you are not subject to any gravitational fields, and you brought your cat along with you. You throw a [`[$m1]\:gram`] cat toy towards your cat at [`[$V1]\:m/s`] and they bat it directly back at you so that it reaches you [`[$P]%`] as fast as you threw it. Assuming your cat’s [`[$m2]\:kg`] paw hit the toy at [`[$V2]\:m/s`], how fast is their paw moving now? Give a positive answer.

_Neglect air friction_

[`V = `][_____]{"$V"}[`m/s`]
