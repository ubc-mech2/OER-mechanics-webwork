BEGIN_PGML

You have been a castaway in your life raft for at least a week. Unfortunately, you have also been paddling in a circle of radius [`[$rB]`] [`m`] at [`[$vB]`] [`m/s`], because you only have one paddle.

You hear a motor boat and you stop paddling, causing your raft to deccelerate at a rate of [`[$aBt]`] [`m/s^2`]. The motor boat is travelling in a circular path of radius [`[$rA]`] [`m`] at a distance of [`[$d]`] [`m`] away from you.

The boat is moving at [`[$vA]`] [`m/s`], and its speed is increasing at a rate of [`[$aAt]`] [`m/s^2`].

You hope they spot you and come to rescue you, however, in the mean time, you decide to pass the time with a physics problem.

What is the magnitude of the motor boat's (A) [`velocity`] relative to your raft (B)?

[`|v_{A/B}|`] [_____]{"$vAB"} [`m/s`]

What is the magnitude of the motor boat's (A) [`acceleration`] relative to your raft (B)?

[`|a_{A/B}|`] [_____]{"$aAB"} [`m/s^2`]
