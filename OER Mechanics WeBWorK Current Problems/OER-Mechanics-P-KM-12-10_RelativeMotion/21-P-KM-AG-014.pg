At the equator, the Earth spins at [`[$v_spin]`] [`km/hr`]. The Earth moves at an average speed of [`[$v_orbit]`] [`km/hr`] around the sun. The sun is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy at a speed of [`[$v_sun]`] [`km/hr`]. The sun’s orbit around the galactic center is at an angle of [`[$theta]`] degrees with the plane in which the planets rotate around the sun. Both the galaxy and the planets of the solar system orbit their centers in a clockwise motion when looking from above. You are driving at [`[$v_you]`] [`km/hr`]  down a road that happens to go exactly on the equator in the direction opposite the spin of the Earth. At the point when you are furthest away from the galactic center, how fast are you travelling with respect to it?

[`v = `][_____]{"$v"}[`km/hr`]
