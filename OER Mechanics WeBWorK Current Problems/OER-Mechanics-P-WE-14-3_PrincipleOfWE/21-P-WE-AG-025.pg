The post office stores all incoming packages in a large warehouse. To get the packages from the warehouse to their customers, they need to load the packages into delivery trucks. They have designed a system where the packages, weighing approximately [`[$W]\:kilograms`], start out at the top of a slide with a minimum velocity of [`v_A=[$Va]\:m/s`], and then are launched from the bottom of the slide into the delivery truck. If [`h_A=[$A]\:m`], [`h_B=[$B]\:m`], and the height of the truck is [`[$C]\:m`], then what is the maximum distance the truck can park away from the edge of the slide so that packages still make it inside?
