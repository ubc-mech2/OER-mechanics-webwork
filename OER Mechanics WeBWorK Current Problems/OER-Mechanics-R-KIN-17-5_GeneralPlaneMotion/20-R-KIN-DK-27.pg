Movers are trying to set up an art gallery. They attempt to drag a human-size statue of a soda can with 
mass [`[$m]`] [`kg`] by tying a rope around it. Determine if the movers can drag the statue along
the floor without it tipping if the coefficients of static friction and kinetic friction are found to be [`\mu_s = `] [`[$mu]`]
and [`\mu_k = `] [`[$muk]`], respectively.

What is the maximum force the movers can apply without tipping the statue?

Assume the statue is a solid cylinder of radius [`r = `][`[$r]`][`m`], height [`h = `][`[$h]`][`m`] and the rope is tied [`y = `][`[$y]`] [`m`] off the ground.
