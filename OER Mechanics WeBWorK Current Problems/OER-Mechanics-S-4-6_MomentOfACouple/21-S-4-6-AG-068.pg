Compression fittings are often used in piping applications to connect tubing to components. They are often composed of a nut and a two-part bearing (a cone and a ring). When you tighten the nut onto the component of interest, the cone pushes onto the ring and squeezes it to the tube, creating a tight seal that cannot be removed. Then, the nut can be removed, and the tube section can even be taken out of the component and moved elsewhere. A pair of non-adjustable wrenches (spanners, if you’re British) is perfect for the job.

What is the Cartesian form of the couple moment in the following system? The other end of the T-junction is already firmly attached to a rigid tube. Take [`F=[$F]\:Newtons`], [`\theta=[$theta]\:degrees`], [`\phi=[$phi]\:degrees`], [`d_{ab}=[$A_cm]\:centimeters`], and [`d_{bc}=[$B_cm]\:centimeters`]. Each wrench/spanner has a length of [`[$D_cm]\:centimeters`].
