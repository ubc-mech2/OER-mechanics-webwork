You are prototyping a new type of garbage disposal, in which a conveyor belt transports waste to be flattened by 
a roller. The roller is intended to be driven by the conveyor belt. In your test run, you start the machine 
with the roller stationary and not in contact with the belt. The roller is then adjusted to make contact with the 
conveyor when the belt is moving at a constant [`v = `] [`[$v]`] [`m/s`].

If the [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`] roller can be treated as a cylinder with mass [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`] and the 
coefficient of kinetic friction between the roller and the conveyor belt is [`\mu_k = `] [`[$mu]`], determine the 
distance the roller travels to reach the same speed as the conveyor belt.

Assume that the roller makes continuous contact from the moment of initial contact, and that the sudden contact 
doesn't slow down the conveyor.

[`d = `] [____]{"$d"} [`m`]
