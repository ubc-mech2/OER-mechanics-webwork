Your client wants to install a giant hanging octagonal fish tank in their living room. They also want to fill the tank before lifting it up to the correct height. 
Your boss tasks you with choosing the appropriate ropes for this task. One thing you need to determine before choosing the material of the rope is the tension that will develop in the ropes. 
Only the ropes going to points [`P_1`], [`P_3`], and [`P_6`] will be load-bearing; the client wants the rest to be decorative. 
If you plan to lift the [`[$W]\:kg`] tank at constant velocity, what will be the tension in each individual rope? 
The tank is [`[$X]\:meters`] wide between parallel sides and the top of the tank will be located [`[$Y]\:meters`] below the hook.

[`T_{P_1} = `][_____]{"$T1"}[`N`]

[`T_{P_3} = `][_____]{"$T1"}[`N`]

[`T_{P_6} = `][_____]{"$T2"}[`N`]
