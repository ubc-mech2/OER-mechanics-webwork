A boat is sitting calmly, anchored in the water, when a bird lands on the boat and then takes off, causing the boat to start bobbing up and down. Given that the cross-sectional area of the bottom of the boat is [`A=[$A]\ m^2`] and the mass of the boat is [`[$m]\ kg`], what is the natural frequency of the boat's oscillations?

Note that the bouyancy force is given by [`F_b=V_Dg\rho`] where [`V_D`] is the volume of the liquid displaced and [`\rho`] is the density of the liquid. (Use [`g=9.81\ m/s^2`] and [`\rho=1000\ kg/m^3`] and assume the cross-sectional area stays constant)

[`\omega_n=`][___]{"$wn"} [`Hz`]

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

The bouyancy force can also be written as [`F_b=A\rho gh`] where [`h`] is the height of water displaced. This can be treated the same as Hooke's law.

END_PGML_HINT

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

The differential equation can be written in the form of Hooke's law by translating the coordinate system so that it is centered at the point of equilibrium.
