This problem is incorrect. The moment of inertia integral is wrong.
Normally, the integral is I=integral(r^2)dm

we can't replace r with y, since the integral bounds aren't as simple with a rectangle.

The problem can be fixed using a constant density 
or using a non constant density in the depth direction
(or giving the student a radius of gyration)
