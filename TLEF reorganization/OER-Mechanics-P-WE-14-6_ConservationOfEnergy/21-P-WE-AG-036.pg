A motorcyclist has been asked to perform a few tricks for a sporting event. They will start by going down a ramp from rest. When they reach the bottom, they will immediately go into a series of two vertical loop-de-loops.
The motorcyclist and their motorcycle have a combined mass of [`[$m]\:kg`] and the motorcyclist starts at a height [`[$h]\:meters`].
What is the maximum radius that a loop can have so that the motorcyclist never loses contact with the pavement?

[`r_1=`][_____]{"$r1"}[`m`]

END_PGML

BEGIN_TEXT
The radius of one of the loops will be exactly equal to the maximum radius. The other loop’s radius will be smaller by \($x\) meters.
Which loop should be smaller? How fast will the motorcyclist be going at the top of the smaller loop? Neglect friction and the size of the motorcycle.
