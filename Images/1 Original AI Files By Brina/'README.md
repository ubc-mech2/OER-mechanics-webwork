<p> These files have been used to create the images for the OER Mechanics Images project. They were created by Brina Schenk with the University of British Columbia Department of Mechanical Engineering and Douglas College Department of Physics and Astronomy. This work was supported by funding from BCcampus (https://bccampus.ca/). </p>

<p> Practice problems based on these images can be found at https://github.com/ubc-mech2/OER-mechanics-webwork. The .png images can be found at: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:OER_Mechanics_Images_by_UBC_Engineering_and_Douglas_College_Physics_and_Astronomy </p>
